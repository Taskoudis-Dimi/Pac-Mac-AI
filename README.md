# Pac-Man-AI
This project includes a Pacman game to which a Tree AI technique (FSM) has been added. The purpose of the project is to move the Ms.Pac-Man through the code and each movement (right, left, up and down) of it is based on the technique (a finite state machine) that was added, in order to achieve the maximum score.
This FSM was created in the file "MyPacMan.java" ("starter\src\main\java\entrants\pacman\username") [Link Text](starter\src\main\java\entrants\pacman\username).
You can see the Tree Structure here.
The technique was added to the (java) code that was running (with Eclipse).
