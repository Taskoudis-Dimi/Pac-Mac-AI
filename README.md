# Pac-Man-AI
Added a technique (tree AI) to ready code that ran the Pacman game. More specifically, a finite state machine was created that returns the motion command for Ms PacMan in every case.
This FSM was created in the file "MyPacMan.java" ("starter\src\main\java\entrants\pacman\username")
The goal is the highest Pac-Man score.
